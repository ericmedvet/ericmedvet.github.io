title: "Thesis proposals"
---

I often and gladly supervise students doing their theses and internships in our research labs, in particular in the one I am the head of, the [Evolutionary Robotics and Artificial Life Lab](https://erallab.inginf.units.it).

Here you can find a list of topics, divided in three categories, partially overlapping.
Most of them are suitable for doing a **research thesis projects**, i.e., something that hopefully will be finalized in a research article to be submitted to an international conference or journal.
Most of them are adequate, in terms of expected quality and quantity of effort to devote, to be tackled as **master thesis** project, i.e., ranging from 15 to 24 CFUs.

To know more about one or few specific topics, please contact me.
