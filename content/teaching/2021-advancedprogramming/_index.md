## Program, goals, requirements

### Detailed program
Available [here, in Italian](https://corsi.units.it/in20/modulo/programmazione-avanzata-316mi-2020-in205-ord-2016-informatica), or [here, in English](https://corsi.units.it/en/in20/teaching-unit/316mi-2020-in205-ord-2016-informatica).

### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know what object-oriented programming is: how to store, process, and access data with objects.
- Know the syntax and the features of the Java programming language and of the Java software platform.
- Know the style conventions for Java language.
- Know Java main frameworks and APIs.
- Know the common structure of the basic development tools, including those for unit testing.
- Understand how a Java program is executed by a computer.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Design, develop, test, and debug complex software in Java.

#### Making judgements
- Decide if Java fits a given programming task.
- Judge the quality of a software written in Java in terms of code style, software artifacts structure, testing, and documentation.

#### Communication skills
- Describe the motivations behind choices in the design and development of a software written in Java.
- Comprehend, formulate, and describe the specifications for a software.

#### Learning skills
- Learn, through software documentation and examples, to use any software written in Java.
- Learn the basics of other object-oriented programming languages.

### Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution.
Basics of computer networks: IP, TCP.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
Italian

### Teaching method
Frontal lessons with blackboard and slide projection; exercises, under teacher's supervision, consisting in solving simple tasks of software design and development in Java.
**Bring your own laptop!**

### Course material
The course material (teacher's slides) will be available.
The full pack of slides might be updated during the course.

The lectures (with the exception of the firt one, due to technical reasons) have been recorded: they are available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTYLIjLghlitd4re0KtZq8nof7XsRFRTq).

### Lectures timetable and course calendar
To be updated.

## End-of-course test (exam)
{{< alert danger >}}
### Important note
Due to the **Covid19** circumstances, the written test might be replaced by an oral interview.
Interviews will be done on the MS Teams platform of UniTs or, in case of problems with the latter, with another similar tool (e.g., Google Meet).
Precise instructions will be given to the students registered for each exam date after the registration deadline and before the exam.
Students who want to listen to others students' interviews, but are not registered, should ask authorization to the teacher.
{{< /alert >}}

The exam works in one of the following ways:
1. Three parts: **Home assignments + Final project + Written test**.
Exam is passed only if the grade is >6/10 on each part. Overall grade is determined as **10%, 60%, 30%**, respectively.
The grades for the Home assignments are communicated during the course.
2. Three parts: **Final project + Written test + Oral exam**.
Exam is passed only if the grade is >6/10 on each part.
Overall grade is determined as **40%, 30%, 30%**, respectively.

The exam may be repeated an unlimited number of times.
Overall grades corresponding to failed exams (with the exception of Project missed deadlines) **will be registered as failed**.
The student may ask to repeat an exam also when passed: acceptance and specific parts to be repeated will be agreed with the teacher.

Student must **register for the exam session** of their interest using the online sistem [esse3](https://esse3.units.it/).
Note that there are **deadlines** for registration (usually 1 week before the session date).

### Final project
At the end of the course, a project will be assigned that consists in the design and development of a software in Java, including testing and a simple documentation and following the provided specifications.
The student will be required to submit the software within a **deadline corresponding to the day of the written test** she/he plans to apply.
The evaluation will be as follows: 0/10 not submitted (missed deadline); 5/10 to 10/10 submitted, depending on quality of code, software structure, documentation, test coverage, degree of working.

**The project assignment is [here](project/)**.

### Written test
Questions on the course program with short open answers and short programming exercise.

### Oral exam
Questions on the course program and short programming exercise.

### Home assignments
During the course, some exercises will be assigned.
Each exercise will consist in the design and development of a simple software in Java; the exercise will start in the classroom under the teacher's supervision.
The student will be required to submit the software within a deadline.
The evaluation of each exercise will be as follows: 0/10 not submitted (missed deadline); 5/10 submitted, but not working; 8/10 submitted and almost fully working; 10/10 submitted and fully working.
The overall Home assignments evaluation will be the average of the exercise evaluations.

Assignments have to be **shared with the teacher** using [repl.it](http://repl.it/).
Students have to **send an email** to the teacher, within the deadline, saying **who they are** and which is the **url of the shared repl**.
Due dates are at 23.59, [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) time.
Please do not change the code in repl after the due date.
