## Program, goals, requirements

### Detailed program
Available [here, in Italian](https://corsi.units.it/in20/modulo/2022/336009/af_gen_cod/316mi), or [here, in English](https://corsi.units.it/en/in20/teaching-unit/2022/336009/af_gen_cod/316mi).

### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know what object-oriented programming is: how to store, process, and access data with objects.
- Know the syntax and the features of the Java programming language and of the Java software platform.
- Know the style conventions for Java language.
- Know Java main frameworks and APIs.
- Know the common structure of the basic development tools, including those for unit testing.
- Understand how a Java program is executed by a computer.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Design, develop, test, and debug complex software in Java.

#### Making judgements
- Decide if Java fits a given programming task.
- Judge the quality of a software written in Java in terms of code style, software artifacts structure, testing, and documentation.

#### Communication skills
- Describe the motivations behind choices in the design and development of a software written in Java.
- Comprehend, formulate, and describe the specifications for a software.

#### Learning skills
- Learn, through software documentation and examples, to use any software written in Java.
- Learn the basics of other object-oriented programming languages.

### Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution.
Basics of computer networks: IP, TCP.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
Italian

### Teaching method
Frontal lessons with blackboard and slide projection; exercises, under teacher's supervision, consisting in solving simple tasks of software design and development in Java.
**Bring your own laptop!**

There will be extra excercise sessions lead by the teaching assistant [Giorgia Nadizar](https://giorgia-nadizar.github.io/).
The details about these sessions will be communicated.

### Course material
The course material (teacher's slides) is served directly from [here](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/slides/advanced-programming-2223).
The slides might be updated during the course.

The lectures will be recorded and made available on Teams.

### Lectures timetable and course calendar
The course will start on **1/3/2023**.

The lectures will be:
- on Wednesday, from 8.30 to 10.00, in room 3B, 3rd floor, building D
- on Thursday, from 8.30 to 11.00, in room 3B, 3rd floor, building D
- on Thursday, from 12.00 to 13.30, in room A, ground floor, building C7

The lectures will be done in person, recorded, and made available on Teams.
For accessing the Teams team, please email me.

#### Short announcements about lectures schedule

## End-of-course test (exam)
The exam works in one of the following ways:
1. Two parts: **Final project + "Short" oral exam**.
Exam is passed only if the grade is >6/10 on each part. Overall grade is determined as **50%, 50%**, respectively.
The grades for the Home assignments are communicated during the course.
2. One part: **Oral exam**.

The exam may be repeated an unlimited number of times.
Overall grades corresponding to failed exams (with the exception of Project missed deadlines) **will be registered as failed**.
The student may ask to repeat an exam also when passed: acceptance and specific parts to be repeated will be agreed with the teacher.

Student must **register for the exam session** of their interest using the online system [esse3](https://esse3.units.it/).
Note that there are **deadlines** for registration (usually 1 week before the session date).

### Final project
At the end of the course, a project will be assigned that consists in the design and development of a software in Java, including testing and a simple documentation and following the provided specifications.
The student will be required to submit the software within a **deadline corresponding to the day of the written test** she/he plans to apply.
The evaluation will be as follows: 0/10 not submitted (missed deadline); 5/10 to 10/10 submitted, depending on quality of code, software structure, documentation, test coverage, degree of working.

**The project assignment is [here](project/)**.

### Oral exam
Questions on the course program and short programming exercise.
