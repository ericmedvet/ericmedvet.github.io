### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know what object-oriented programming is: how to store, process, and access data with objects.
- Know the syntax and the features of the Java programming language and of the Java software platform.
- Know the style conventions for Java language.
- Know Java main frameworks and APIs.
- Know the common structure of the basic development tools, including those for unit testing.
- Understand how a Java program is executed by a computer.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Design, develop, test, and debug complex software in Java.

#### Making judgements
- Decide if Java fits a given programming task.
- Judge the quality of a software written in Java in terms of code style, software artifacts structure, testing, and documentation.

#### Communication skills
- Describe the motivations behind choices in the design and development of a software written in Java.
- Comprehend, formulate, and describe the specifications for a software.

#### Learning skills
- Learn, through software documentation and examples, to use any software written in Java.
- Learn the basics of other object-oriented programming languages.

### Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution.
Basics of computer networks: IP, TCP.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
Italian

### Teaching method
Frontal lessons with blackboard and slide projection; exercises, under teacher's supervision, consisting in solving simple tasks of software design and development in Java.
**Bring your own laptop!**

There will be extra excercise sessions led by the teaching assistant [Giorgia Nadizar](https://giorgia-nadizar.github.io/).
The details about these sessions will be communicated.

### Course material
The course material (teacher's slides) is served directly from [here](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/slides/advanced-programming-2425).
The slides might be updated during the course.

The lectures will be recorded and made available on Teams.

### Lectures timetable and course calendar
The course will start on **3/3/2025**.

The lectures will be:
- on Monday, from **9.00 to 10.30** (academic: 9.00-11.00) in **Arich Room, building B**
- on Wednesday, from **9.00 to 10.30** (academic: 9.00-11.00) in **Room A, building C8**
- on Friday, from **11.00 to 13.30** (academic: 11.00-14.00) in **Room A, building C8**

The lectures will be done in person, recorded, and made available on Teams.
Students enrolled in this course should already be able to access the team of the course.

#### Short announcements about lectures schedule

- There will be some modification to let us complete the 72 hours within May 2025. In particular, there will be two more lectures out of the usual timetable, on **19/5 14.00-16.30** (academic: 14.00-17.00) in **Room A, building C9** and on **22/5 9.00-11.30** (academic: 9.00-12.00) in **Room E, building D**. Moreover, the lecture of **23/5** will start at **12.00** instead of 11.
- The lecture of **23/4** is cancelled, as I am involved in the organization of the [evostar 2025 conference](https://www.evostar.org/2025/).
- There will be no lecture on **18/4** and **21/4**, for Easter holydays, and of **25/4**, for the national holyday.
- The lectures of **11/4** is cancelled as it collides with the "Porte Aperte Magistrali per Ingegneria" initiative: I invite students to take part in that initiative.
- The lectures of **31/3** and **2/4** are cancelled because I'll be abroad (Amsterdam) for scientific reasons.
- The lecture of **21/3** is cancelled (that is, the course will continue from the next lecture) because of my involvement in the institutional initiative named *Porte aperte*.

## End-of-course test (exam)
The student can pass the exam in one of the following ways (student's choice):
1. Two parts: **Final project + "Short" oral exam**.
Exam is passed only if the grade is >6/10 on each part. Overall grade is determined as **50%, 50%**.
2. One part: **Oral exam**.

The exam may be repeated an unlimited number of times.
Overall grades corresponding to failed exams (with the exception of Project missed deadlines) **will be registered as failed**.
The student may ask to repeat an exam also when passed: acceptance and specific parts to be repeated will be agreed with the teacher.

Student must **register for the exam session** of their interest using the online system [esse3](https://esse3.units.it/).
Note that there are **deadlines** for registration (usually 1 week before the session date).

### Final project
At the end of the course, a project will be assigned that consists in the design and development of a software in Java, including testing and a simple documentation and following the provided specifications.
The student will be required to submit the software within a **deadline corresponding to the day of the written test** she/he plans to apply.
The evaluation will be as follows: 0/10 not submitted (missed deadline); 5/10 to 10/10 submitted, depending on quality of code, software structure, documentation, test coverage, degree of working.

**The project assignment is [here](project/)**.

### Oral exam
Questions on the the main and minor concepts and short **programming exercise**.

## About generative AI

Generative AI (that is, **Large Language Models like ChatGPT**) is, in general, a useful tool for programming and can also be **useful for students** who are learning how to program.
There are, however, **pros and cons**, that are not yet fully known.
Here a few pointers:
- Valov√Ω, Marcel, and Alena Buchalcevova. "The psychological effects of AI-assisted programming on students and professionals." 2023 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME). IEEE, 2023.
- Song, Fangchen, Ashish Agarwal, and Wen Wen. "The impact of generative AI on collaborative open-source software development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot." arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.02091 (2024).

The key messages which the teacher will attempt to deliver during this course are:
1. the human (here, the student) is the only **responsible** for the produced content, even if obtained through generative AI (see also below);
2. **the larger the role generative AI** is playing in producing a content (here, designing and implementing a software system), the smaller the human's (here, the student's) role; hence, **the less useful the human**.

### Generative AI and the exam

In any type of content produced by the student for admission to or participation in an exam (projects, reports, exercises, tests), the use of Large Language Model tools (such as ChatGPT and the like) must be explicitly declared.
This requirement must be met even in the case of partial use.
Regardless of the method of assessment, the teacher reserves the right to further investigate the student's actual contribution with an oral exam for any type of content produced.
