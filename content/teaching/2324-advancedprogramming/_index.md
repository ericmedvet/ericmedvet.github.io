## Program, goals, requirements

### Detailed program
Available [here](https://units.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2023/118852/2016/6/10424?coorte=2021&schemaid=12073).

### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know what object-oriented programming is: how to store, process, and access data with objects.
- Know the syntax and the features of the Java programming language and of the Java software platform.
- Know the style conventions for Java language.
- Know Java main frameworks and APIs.
- Know the common structure of the basic development tools, including those for unit testing.
- Understand how a Java program is executed by a computer.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Design, develop, test, and debug complex software in Java.

#### Making judgements
- Decide if Java fits a given programming task.
- Judge the quality of a software written in Java in terms of code style, software artifacts structure, testing, and documentation.

#### Communication skills
- Describe the motivations behind choices in the design and development of a software written in Java.
- Comprehend, formulate, and describe the specifications for a software.

#### Learning skills
- Learn, through software documentation and examples, to use any software written in Java.
- Learn the basics of other object-oriented programming languages.

### Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution.
Basics of computer networks: IP, TCP.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
Italian

### Teaching method
Frontal lessons with blackboard and slide projection; exercises, under teacher's supervision, consisting in solving simple tasks of software design and development in Java.
**Bring your own laptop!**

There will be extra excercise sessions led by the teaching assistant [Giorgia Nadizar](https://giorgia-nadizar.github.io/).
The details about these sessions will be communicated.

### Course material
The course material (teacher's slides) is served directly from [here](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/slides/advanced-programming-2324).
The slides might be updated during the course.

The lectures will be recorded and made available on Teams.

### Lectures timetable and course calendar
The course will start on **4/3/2024**.

The lectures will be:
- on Monday, from **9.15 to 10.45** (academic: 9.00-11.00)
- on Wednesday, from **8.30 to 11.00** (academic: 8.00-11.00)
- on Thursday, from **9.00 to 11.30** (academic: 9.00-12.00)

All the lectures will be in **room A, ground floor, building C9**.

The lectures will be done in person, recorded, and made available on Teams.
Students enrolled in this course should already be able to access the team of the course.

#### Short announcements about lectures schedule

There lecture will be no lectures during the week after Easter (1/4 to 7/4) because I will be attending a [conference](https://www.evostar.org/2024/).

## End-of-course test (exam)
The student can pass the exam in one of the following ways (student's choice):
1. Two parts: **Final project + "Short" oral exam**.
Exam is passed only if the grade is >6/10 on each part. Overall grade is determined as **50%, 50%**.
2. One part: **Oral exam**.

The exam may be repeated an unlimited number of times.
Overall grades corresponding to failed exams (with the exception of Project missed deadlines) **will be registered as failed**.
The student may ask to repeat an exam also when passed: acceptance and specific parts to be repeated will be agreed with the teacher.

Student must **register for the exam session** of their interest using the online system [esse3](https://esse3.units.it/).
Note that there are **deadlines** for registration (usually 1 week before the session date).

### Final project
At the end of the course, a project will be assigned that consists in the design and development of a software in Java, including testing and a simple documentation and following the provided specifications.
The student will be required to submit the software within a **deadline corresponding to the day of the written test** she/he plans to apply.
The evaluation will be as follows: 0/10 not submitted (missed deadline); 5/10 to 10/10 submitted, depending on quality of code, software structure, documentation, test coverage, degree of working.

**The project assignment is [here](project/)**.

### Oral exam
Questions on the the main and minor concepts and short programming exercise.
