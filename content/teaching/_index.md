## Supervision
If you are a student (here at University of Trieste, or from another institution) and want to work with me while pursuing your **thesis** or **as an intern**, please look at my list of [thesis proposals](theses/) and then contact me.

If you are a student enroled in the bachelor program (**laurea triennale** in) [Ingegneria Elettronica e Informatica](https://corsi.units.it/in05/ingegneria-elettronica-informatica), you might be interested in my list of [fast track thesis proposals](fast-track/).

Finally, if you are going to write with me a technical and/or scientific document (e.g., the **thesis**, a **scientific article**), you might want to look at my [advices on how to write](how-to-write/) this kind of documents.
