This page is about the course named:
- Evolutionary Robotics (456MI-2), for master programs [IN23](https://corsi.units.it/IN23/descrizione-corso) and [IN19](https://corsi.units.it/IN19/descrizione-corso), **3 CFUs**, part of a larger course named "Machine Learning and Evolutionary Robotics"

## Program, goals, requirements

### Detailed program
- Evolutionary Computation (EC).
  - High-level working scheme of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA); terminology.
  - Generational model; selection criteria; exploration/exploitation trade-off; genetic operators with examples; fitness function; multi-objective optimization and Pareto dominance; debugging of an evolutionary search.
  - EA issues (diversity, variational inheritance, expressiveness); fitness landscape; properties of the representation.
  - Examples of common EAs: GA, GP, GE.
- Evolutionary Robotics.
  - Agent and environment.
  - Brief foundations of Artificial Neural Networks and EC.
    - EA for neuroevolution.
  - Significant examples.
    - Evolution of Soft Robots morphologies (body).
    - Evolution of robotic agents controllers (brain).
    - Simultaneous evolution of body and brain.
  - Choosing the task, the fitness; reality gap.

### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know and understand the main kinds of optimization problems which can be tackled with EC, in particular in the field of robotics.
- Know the terminology and common mathematical notation for the key concepts of EC and ER.
- Know and understand the main EAs.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Formulate formally the statement of an optimization problem, using the proper terminology and mathematical notation, in order to tackle them with EC techniques.
- Design and develop simple EAs.

#### Making judgements
- Judge if a problem can be tackled with EC, possibly re-using existing software libraries.
- Judge the technical soundness of the application of EC techniques, in particular in the field of robotics.

#### Communication skills
- Describe, both in written and oral form, the main components of an EA and its application to a robotics problem, using the proper terminology.

#### Learning skills.
- Retrieve information from scientific publications about EC and ER techniques not explicitly presented in this course.

### Requirements
- Basics of statistics: basic graphical tools of data exploration; summary measures of variable distribution (mean, variance, quantiles); fundamentals of probability.
- Basics of linear algebra: vectors, matrices, matrix operations.
- Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution, tree.
- Familiarity with manipulation of mathematical notation.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
English

### Teaching method
Frontal lectures with slide projection and live annotation; lab activities, under teacher supervision, in dealing with simple problems with ML techniques.

### Course material

#### Teacher slides and lab sketches
The course material (teacher's slides) is available [online](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/slides/er-2526/).

The slides might be updated during the course.

The recordings of the lectures will be available on the [MS Teams team of the course](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ABT938HF-WV0e7hmrrcTWPVe6T8vuyJvJLYp1ExCMjOU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=19cd013b-7b9f-466e-a2b1-307e8a94a7ef&tenantId=a54b3635-128c-460f-b967-6ded8df82e75) (code `bb7s7tx`).

### Lectures timetable and course calendar
The course will start on **September 24**.
Lectures will be held in:
- Room D, building A, Piazzale Europa Campus on Wednesday, 9.00-12.00 (in practice, **9.00-11.30** without breaks)

The lectures will be given **in person** and **I recommend being in the room**.
In compliance with the current regulation students might be required to book a place in the room.

The lectures will **not** be cast in streaming, but the recordings of the lectures will be available on the [MS Teams team of the course](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ABT938HF-WV0e7hmrrcTWPVe6T8vuyJvJLYp1ExCMjOU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=19cd013b-7b9f-466e-a2b1-307e8a94a7ef&tenantId=a54b3635-128c-460f-b967-6ded8df82e75) (code `bb7s7tx`).

#### Short announcements about lectures schedule
- The *official* lectures have ended. There will be two supplementary lectures (with usual time and room):
  - on 3/12/25, only with the tutor, Michel El Saliby, for continuing the lab activity on the development of an EA;
  - on 10/12/25, with me.
- There will be **no lecture on 29/10/25** as I will be attending [The International Conference on Machine Intelligence and Nature-inspireD Computing (MIND)](https://www.ic-mind.org/) (and presenting [this research](../../publications/2025-c-dem-role/)).
- The **lecture of 8/10/2025 is cancelled** (i.e., all the subsequent lecture are shift by one week) because most of the students are involved in their Bachelor ceremony.

## End-of-course test (exam)
The exam is done together with the exam of [Machine Learning](../2526-ml/) with the same [rules](../2526-ml/#end-of-course-test-exam) and dates.
Obviously, the questions are about ER, not ML.
