This page is about the **PhD** course Evolutionary Robotics, for the PhD programs:
- [Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (ADSAI)](https://adsai.units.it/)
- [Ingegneria Industriale e dell'Informazione](https://web.units.it/dottorato/ingii/)

For both, the course accounts for 1.5 CFUs and lasts 12 hours.

## Program, goals, requirements

### Detailed program (12h)

- Evolutionary computation (EC).
  - Definition of global optimization problem; evolutionary algorithm (EA); selection criteria; exploration/exploitation trade-off; multi-objective problems; solution representation; popular representations with their initialization and genetic operators; properties of the representation.
  - Main EAs: genetic algorithm (GA), random search, random walk, genetic programming (GP), grammatical evolution (GE), evolutionary strategies (ES), MAP-Elites.
  - Comparing EAs.
- EC applications (example of) EC to robotics
  - Evolution of robotic agents controllers (brain).
  - Evolution of Soft Robots morphologies (body).  
  - Simultaneous evolution of body and brain.
  - Choosing the task, the fitness; reality gap.

### Goal of the course

#### Knowledge and understanding
- Know the terminology and common mathematical notation for the key concepts of EC.
- Know and understand the working scheme of EAs.
- Know and understand the main assessment procedures for EAs.
- Know and understand the main usages of EC for robotics.

#### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Formulate a formal problem statement, using the proper terminology and mathematical notation, for simple practical problems in order to tackle them EC techniques.

#### Making judgements
- Judge if a problem can be tackled with EC.
- Judge the technical soundness of an EC system.
- Judge the technical soundness of the assessment of an EC system.

#### Communication skills
- Describe, both in written and oral form, the motivations behind choices in the design, development, and assessment of a EC system, in particular for robotics, using the proper terminology and possibly exploiting simple plots.

#### Learning skills
- Retrieve information from scientific publications about EC techniques, in particular when applied to robotics.

### Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution, tree.

Strong familiarity with manipulation of mathematical notation.

## Method, language, material

### Language of teaching
English

### Teaching method
Frontal lectures with slide projection and live annotation on the blackboard.

### Course material

#### Teacher's slides
The course material (teacher's slides) are [available online](https://medvet.inginf.units.it/slides/evolutionary-robotics-phd-24).

### Lectures timetable and course calendar

Lectures will be held in **Room A, 2nd floor, building C5**, Piazzale Europa Campus on:
- Monday 12/2, 9.00-12.00 (in practice, **9.00-11.30**)
- Tuesday 13/2, 9.00-12.00 (in practice, **9.00-11.30**)
- Friday 16/2, 9.00-12.00 (in practice, **9.00-11.30**)

and, in **Room A, 2nd floor, building C5**, Piazzale Europa Campus, on:
- Tuesday 20/2, 9.00-12.00 (in practice, **9.00-11.30**)

The lectures will be given **in person** and **I recommend being in the room**.
The lectures will **not** be cast in streaming, but the recordings of the lectures will be available.


## End-of-course test (exam)
The exam is passed without a grade.
For passing the exam, the student is required to deliver a short oral presentation of a research paper chosen, by the student, from a teacher-provided list of ER papers.

The presentation has to be done in English, with slides prepared by the student, and last at most 10 minutes.
 
The presentation date is set in agreement with the teacher: please try to arrange sessions with more than one student at once.
