## Goal of the course

### Knowledge and understanding
- Know what object-oriented programming is: how to store, process, and access data with objects.
- Know the syntax and the features of the Java programming language and of the Java software platform.
- Know the style conventions for Java language.
- Know Java main frameworks and APIs.
- Know the common structure of the basic development tools, including those for unit testing.
- Understand how a Java program is executed by a computer.

### Applying knowledge and understanding
- Design, develop, test, and debug complex software in Java.

### Making judgements
- Decide if Java fits a given programming task.
- Judge the quality of a software written in Java in terms of code style, software artifacts structure, testing, and documentation.

### Communication skills
- Describe the motivations behind choices in the design and development of a software written in Java.
- Comprehend, formulate, and describe the specifications for a software.

### Learning skills
- Learn, through software documentation and examples, to use any software written in Java.
- Learn the basics of other object-oriented programming languages.

## Requirements
Basics of programming and data structures: algorithm, data types, loops, recursion, parallel execution.
Basics of computer networks: IP, TCP.

## Teaching method
Frontal lessons with blackboard and slide projection; exercises, under teacher's supervision, consisting in solving simple tasks of software design and development in Java.
**Bring your own laptop!**

## Lessons timetable and course calendar
The course will start on **2 March 2020**.

## End-of-course test (exam)

### Important note
Due to the **Covid19** circumstances, the written test might be replaced by an oral interview.
Interviews will be done on the MS Teams platform of UniTs or, in case of problems with the latter, with another similar tool (e.g., Google Meet).
Precise instruction will be given to the students registered for each exam date after the registration deadline and before the exam.
Students who want to listen to others students' interviews, but are not registered, should ask authorization to the teacher.
