## Abstract
Several nomograms have been developed to predict prostate cancer upgrading however very little artificial intelligence (AI) tools are available for this purpose. Aim of our study was to test the feasibility of AI to predict upgrading in patients with PCa undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy.
