## Abstract
Several research efforts have shown that a similarity function synthesized from examples may capture an application-specific similarity criterion in a way that fits the application needs more effectively than a generic distance definition. In this work, we propose a similarity learning algorithm tailored to problems of syntax-based entity extraction from unstructured text streams. The algorithm takes in input pairs of strings along with an indication of whether they adhere or not adhere to the same syntactic pattern. Our approach is based on Grammatical Evolution and explores systematically a similarity definition space including all functions that may be expressed with a specialized, simple language that we have defined for this purpose. We assessed our proposal on patterns representative of practical applications. The results suggest that the proposed approach is indeed feasible and that the learned similarity function is more effective than the Levenshtein distance and the Jaccard similarity index.
