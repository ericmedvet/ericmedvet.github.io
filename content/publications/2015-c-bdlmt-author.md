## Abstract
We describe the approach that we submitted to the 2015 PAN competition for the author profiling task. The task consists in predicting some attributes of an author analyzing a set of his/her Twitter tweets.We consider several sets of stylometric and content features, and different decision algorithms: we use a different combination of features and decision algorithm for each language-attribute pair, hence treating it as an individual problem.
