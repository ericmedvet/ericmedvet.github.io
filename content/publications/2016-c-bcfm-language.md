## Abstract
We consider the problem of the filtering of Twitter posts, that is, the hiding of those posts which the user prefers not to visualize on his/her timeline. We define a language for specifying filtering policies suitable for Twitter posts. The language allows each user to decide which posts to filter out based on his/her sensibility and preferences. Since average users may not have the skills necessary to translate their filtering needs into a set of rules, we also propose a method for inferring a policy automatically, based solely on examples of the desired filtering behavior. The method is based on an evolutionary approach driven by a multi-objective optimization scheme. We assess our proposal experimentally on a real Twitter dataset and the results are highly promising.
